# Real Time Bus Tracker
This repository contains the Real Time Bus Tracker Portfolio Project, which is a JavaScript-based exercise that involves creating a real-time bus tracker that uses the Mapbox API and the MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) API.
## Instructions

1. Obtain your Mapbox API key by signing up for a free account at Mapbox.
2. Obtain your MBTA API key by signing up for a free account at MBTA API.
3. Create a config.js file, that contains your Mapbox API key and your MBTA API key.
4. Open the index.html file in your browser to view the Real Time Bus Tracker.
